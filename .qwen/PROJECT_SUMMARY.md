# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
To enhance the Lumsden Tourist Map Generator by fixing failing tests, improving elevation data integration, and expanding map content to create a comprehensive tourist information resource.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Python 3.12, Mapnik for rendering, GDAL/OGR for data processing
- **Architecture**: Configuration-driven approach with JSON files, modular design with utils/ directory, Nix for dependency management
- **Core Components**: OSM data processing pipeline, elevation data generation with hillshading, contour line generation, Mapnik XML styling templates
- **Testing**: Pytest-based test suite with 80 tests, GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with test and lint jobs
- **File Structure**: Key directories include config/, data/, docs/, icons/, styles/, utils/, tests/
- **Build Process**: Uses nix-shell for dependency management and consistent environment
- **Key Files**:
  - `map_generator.py`: Main entry point
  - `utils/elevation_processing.py`: Elevation data handling
  - `styles/tourist.xml`: Mapnik style template
  - `config/areas.json`: Area configuration

## Recent Actions
- **Fixed Failing Tests**: Resolved two failing tests in `test_elevation_processing.py` by adding a `force_subprocess` parameter to allow proper testing of subprocess paths
- **Test Suite Verification**: Confirmed all 80 tests now pass after fixes
- **Functionality Validation**: Verified map generator still works correctly with hillshading and other features
- **Code Modifications**: Updated `utils/elevation_processing.py` and `tests/test_elevation_processing.py` to make tests controllable for different code paths
- **Enhanced Elevation Data Integration**: Added support for multiple DEM sources including SRTM with configurable options
- **Expanded Content Categories**: Added new content categories including outdoor recreation, nature reserves, historical sites, and emergency services
- **Fixed OSM Data Directory Handling**: Addressed an issue where the map generator would fail when GDAL was not available

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Analyze failing tests in elevation processing
2. [DONE] Fix test_download_elevation_data_failure - ensure function returns False when subprocess fails
3. [DONE] Fix test_download_elevation_data_success - ensure subprocess is called when expected
4. [DONE] Run tests to verify fixes
5. [DONE] Commit changes to version control
6. [DONE] Enhance elevation data integration with real DEM sources (SRTM, OS Terrain 50)
7. [DONE] Expand content categories from current 25+ to even more comprehensive coverage
8. [TODO] Improve cartographic features like labeling, navigation aids, and visual design
9. [TODO] Implement real-time information sources and quality validation systems
