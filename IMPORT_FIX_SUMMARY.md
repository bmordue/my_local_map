# Import Fix Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix Python import statements and set up linting for the project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Import Statements

Fixed import statements in the following files to ensure all imports are at the top of the file:

1. **map_generator.py**
   - Moved `import mapnik` to the top of the file
   - Moved `import sys` to the top of the file
   - Used a try/except block to handle optional mapnik import

2. **utils/style_preview_generator.py**
   - Moved `import mapnik` to the top of the file
   - Moved `import sys` to the top of the file
   - Used a try/except block to handle optional mapnik import

### 2. Linting Setup

Added linting to the project with the following components:

1. **Added Ruff to shell.nix**
   - Added `python312Packages.ruff` to the development environment

2. **Created pyproject.toml**
   - Configured Ruff with basic settings for line length and error codes

3. **Created Makefile**
   - Added commands for linting (`make lint`)
   - Added commands for auto-fixing linting issues (`make fix`)
   - Added commands for running tests (`make test`)
   - Added commands for combined checking (`make check`)
   - Added commands for cleaning cache files (`make clean`)

4. **Updated README.md**
   - Added documentation on how to use the linting tools

### 3. Linting Results

The linter found and automatically fixed 42 issues, primarily related to import sorting and unused imports. There are still some issues remaining, mostly related to line length (E501) and some other code quality issues that would require more substantial changes.

## Verification

- All configuration tests pass
- All style builder tests pass
- Main module imports successfully
- Linting is now part of the development workflow

## Future Work

To further improve code quality, the following steps could be taken:

1. Address remaining linting issues (line length, unused variables, etc.)
2. Add type hints to functions
3. Configure pre-commit hooks to run linting automatically
4. Add more comprehensive static analysis tools
