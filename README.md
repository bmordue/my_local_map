## Automated Map Generation

### PR Map Generation Workflow

Every pull request to the `main` branch automatically generates a tourist map, allowing visual review of changes:

How it works:
1. Automatic Trigger: Workflow runs on every PR to `main`
2. Map Generation: Creates the full Lumsden tourist map (A3, 3507×4960 pixels)
3. Artifact Upload: Map files are uploaded as downloadable artifacts
4. Visual Review: Download and compare maps to see the impact of your changes

How to access generated maps:
1. Go to the Actions tab of your PR
2. Click on the "Generate Tourist Map on PR" workflow run
3. Download the `lumsden-tourist-map-pr-{number}` artifact
4. Extract and view the PNG file

Generated artifacts include:
- `lumsden_tourist_map_A3.png` - The complete tourist map
- `tourist_map_style.xml` - Mapnik style definition

Perfect for reviewing changes to styling, data processing, or map generation logic! 

## Contributing

This project demonstrates how to transform a basic map into a comprehensive tourist resource. The modular design allows for easy extension with additional data sources and features.

Pull requests are welcome! The automated map generation workflow will help you visualize the impact of your changes.
