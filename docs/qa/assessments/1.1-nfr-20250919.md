# NFR Assessment: Story 1.1 - Expand Geographic Coverage

## Executive Summary

This story successfully implements the capability to generate maps for multiple areas in Aberdeenshire. The implementation adheres to the project's architectural principles and maintains the existing functionality for the Lumsden area. The configuration-driven approach supports easy addition of new areas without code changes, which aligns with the maintainability NFR. However, there are some concerns regarding test coverage and reliability that need to be addressed.

## NFR Validation

### Security

**Status:** PASS

**Assessment:** The application processes local data files and doesn't handle user input or external network connections in a way that would create significant security risks. No major security vulnerabilities were identified.

### Performance

**Status:** PASS

**Assessment:** Performance is primarily dependent on external services like the Overpass API and local GDAL processing. The implementation doesn't introduce any significant performance bottlenecks. Map generation time will vary based on area size and data complexity, which is expected.

### Reliability

**Status:** CONCERNS

**Assessment:** Some integration tests are failing, indicating potential reliability issues. Specifically, three tests in `tests/test_integration.py` are failing due to a `KeyError: 'name'` when accessing `area_config['name']`. This suggests that the application might crash when generating maps for areas where the configuration doesn't include a 'name' field. This needs to be addressed to ensure the application is reliable.

### Maintainability

**Status:** PASS

**Assessment:** The code is well-structured and follows the established patterns. The configuration-driven approach allows for easy addition of new areas without code changes, which enhances maintainability. The modular design and clear separation of concerns also contribute positively to maintainability.

### Usability

**Status:** PASS (Implied)

**Assessment:** The story successfully meets the user's need to view maps of multiple areas in Aberdeenshire. The command-line interface for area selection is straightforward. While not explicitly tested, the implementation appears to be usable for its intended purpose.

### Testability

**Status:** CONCERNS

**Assessment:** While unit tests for individual components are comprehensive, the integration tests have revealed issues. The failing tests indicate gaps in the test coverage for the main application flow. Additionally, the test suite produces warnings about unknown pytest marks, suggesting a need for better test configuration.

## Detailed Findings

1.  **Configuration Handling:** The main application expects an 'name' field in the area configuration, but this is not consistently provided in the tests. This led to `KeyError` exceptions in integration tests and potentially in real usage if an area configuration is missing this field.
2.  **Test Coverage:** The failing integration tests highlight a gap in testing the main application flow with different area configurations. The tests should be updated to match the actual configuration structure and verify that the application handles all required fields correctly.
3.  **Test Configuration:** The test suite produces warnings about unknown pytest marks. These should be registered in `pytest.ini` to improve the clarity and maintainability of the test suite.

## Recommendations

1.  **Fix Failing Integration Tests:** Address the `KeyError: 'name'` issue by ensuring that all area configurations include the required fields and that the tests are updated to match the actual configuration structure.
2.  **Improve Test Configuration:** Register the custom pytest marks (`unit`, `integration`) in `pytest.ini` to eliminate warnings and improve test suite clarity.
3.  **Add Input Validation:** Consider adding validation in `map_generator.py` to check for required fields in the area configuration and provide informative error messages if they are missing.
