## Document Sections

1. [Overview](01_overview.md) - High-level description of the project
2. [Architecture](02_architecture.md) - System architecture and core components
3. [Technology Stack](03_technology_stack.md) - Core technologies, libraries, and system dependencies
4. [Data Flow](04_data_flow.md) - Step-by-step data processing flow
5. [File Structure](05_file_structure.md) - Project directory structure and key files
6. [Key Modules](06_key_modules.md) - Detailed description of important modules
7. [Map Styling System](07_map_styling_system.md) - Map styling approach and categories
8. [Configuration System](08_configuration_system.md) - Configuration files and settings
9. [Data Sources](09_data_sources.md) - Primary and enhanced data sources
10. [Output Specifications](10_output_specifications.md) - Map and style output details
11. [Development Environment](11_development_environment.md) - Development setup and dependencies
12. [Testing](12_testing.md) - Testing infrastructure and approach

## Purpose

This sharded structure allows team members to focus on specific aspects of the system architecture without being overwhelmed by the entire document. It also facilitates easier updates and maintenance of individual sections.
