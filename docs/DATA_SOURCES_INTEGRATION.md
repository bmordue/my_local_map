# Data Sources Integration Guide

This document outlines how to integrate various data sources to enhance the Lumsden tourist map beyond OpenStreetMap data.

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
- **Fixed OSM Query**: Updated Overpass API query to include complete node data
- **Enhanced Map Style**: Comprehensive styling for 25+ feature types including:
  - Detailed land use categories (residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural)
  - Natural features (heath, moors, wetlands, forests)
  - Transportation (railways, paths, cycling infrastructure)
  - Comprehensive POI categories (50+ amenity types)
  - Building categorization with specific styling
  - Place labels and typography

- **Sample Tourist Database**: Created comprehensive SQLite database with:
  - Tourist attractions with ratings, opening hours, accessibility
  - Accommodation with amenities and pricing
  - Dining venues with cuisine types and features  
  - Activities with booking requirements and difficulty levels
  - Walking trails with distances and waymarking

- **GeoJSON Export**: Exported all tourist data to GeoJSON format for mapping integration

- **âœ¨ Ordnance Survey Data Integration**: Added comprehensive OS data layer support including:
  - **OS Open Roads**: Road network data with classification (A roads, B roads, unclassified)
  - **OS Boundary-Line**: Administrative and electoral boundaries  
  - **OS Open Greenspace**: Public rights of way and green spaces
  - **Configurable styling**: Customizable colors, line weights, and opacity for each layer type
  - **Graceful fallback**: Robust error handling when OS data is unavailable
  - **Mock data support**: Demonstration capabilities for development and testing

### ðŸ”§ Data Source Integration Options

#### 1. OpenStreetMap Enhancement
**Current Status**: OSM query fixed but data extraction needs node coordinates
**Next Steps**:
- Test with live Overpass API when network access available
- Implement local OSM data enhancement with missing features
- Add quality validation and data completeness checking

#### 2. Ordnance Survey Data âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
**Current Integration**:
- **OS Open Roads**: Integrated road network with A/B road classification
- **OS Boundary-Line**: Administrative boundaries for context
- **OS Open Greenspace**: Rights of way including footpaths and bridleways
- **Mock Data System**: Demonstrates integration capabilities
- **Configuration Support**: Enable/disable layers via `config/areas.json`

**Configuration Example**:
```json
"ordnance_survey": {
  "enabled": true,
  "layers": ["roads", "boundaries", "rights_of_way"],
  "style": {
    "roads": {
      "primary_color": "#CC6600",
      "primary_width": 2.0,
      "secondary_color": "#FF9933",
      "secondary_width": 1.5
    },
    "boundaries": {
      "admin_color": "#8B4513",
      "admin_width": 1.2,
      "admin_opacity": 0.8
    },
    "rights_of_way": {
      "footpath_color": "#228B22",
      "footpath_width": 1.0
    }
  }
}
```

**Real Implementation Notes**:
```bash
# In production, would download actual OS Open Data:
wget https://api.os.uk/downloads/v1/products/OpenRoads/downloads?area=GB&format=ESRI+Shapefile

# Convert to map-ready format:
ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" enhanced_data/os_roads.shp OS_OpenRoads.shp
```

#### 3. Historic Environment Data
**Sources**:
- **Historic Environment Scotland**: Scheduled monuments, listed buildings
- **National Record of the Historic Environment**: Archaeological sites
- **Local authority heritage databases**: Conservation areas

**Integration Example**:
```python
# Download heritage data
heritage_url = "https://portal.historicenvironment.scot/spatialdownloads"
# Process and add to map layers
```

#### 4. Tourism Board Data
**Sources**:
- **VisitScotland**: Official tourist attractions
- **Local tourism boards**: Regional attractions and events
- **TripAdvisor/Google Places**: Reviews and ratings
- **Booking platforms**: Accommodation availability and pricing

#### 5. Weather and Seasonal Data
**Integration**:
- **Met Office API**: Current weather and forecasts
- **Seasonal information**: Opening times, accessibility changes
- **Trail conditions**: Weather-dependent route recommendations

#### 6. Transportation Data
**Sources**:
- **Traveline Scotland**: Public transport routes and schedules
- **Traffic Scotland**: Road conditions and closures
- **Cycle route networks**: National Cycle Network data
- **Park and ride facilities**: Location and capacity

#### 7. Local Authority Data
**Aberdeen City Council / Aberdeenshire Council**:
- **Planning applications**: Development information
- **Environmental health**: Food hygiene ratings
- **Community facilities**: Libraries, recycling centers
- **Events calendar**: Local events and festivals

## Enhanced Map Layers Implementation

### 1. Topographic Enhancement
```python
def add_elevation_data():
    """Add contour lines and elevation shading"""
    # SRTM 30m resolution data
    # Process with GDAL to create contours
    # Add hill shading for terrain visualization
```

### 2. Dynamic POI Updates
```python
def update_poi_from_apis():
    """Update POI data from multiple sources"""
    # Google Places API for current business information
    # Social media APIs for events and temporary attractions
    # Weather APIs for seasonal accessibility
```

### 3. Route Planning Integration
```python
def add_route_planning():
    """Add route planning capabilities"""
    # Walking route optimization
    # Accessibility route options
    # Multi-modal transport integration
```

### 4. Real-time Information
```python
def add_realtime_data():
    """Add live information overlays"""
    # Current weather conditions
    # Traffic and road conditions
    # Event schedules and availability
```

## Quality Assurance and Validation

### Data Quality Checks
- **Coordinate validation**: Ensure all points fall within map bounds
- **Attribute completeness**: Verify required fields are populated
- **Temporal validation**: Check opening hours and seasonal information
- **Cross-reference validation**: Compare multiple sources for accuracy

### Update Procedures
- **Automated updates**: Scheduled data refresh from APIs
- **Manual curation**: Local knowledge integration
- **Community input**: User-generated content validation
- **Version control**: Track data changes and sources

## Technical Architecture

### Data Pipeline
```
External APIs â†’ Data Validation â†’ Database Storage â†’ GeoJSON Export â†’ Map Rendering
```

### Storage Solutions
- **SQLite**: Local storage for tourist database
- **PostgreSQL/PostGIS**: For larger datasets with spatial indexing
- **File-based**: GeoJSON/Shapefile for simple integration

### Performance Optimization
- **Spatial indexing**: Fast geographic queries
- **Data caching**: Reduce API calls and load times
- **Level-of-detail**: Show appropriate detail at each zoom level
- **Tile generation**: Pre-render map tiles for web deployment

## Future Enhancements

### Interactive Features
- **Web map version**: Online interactive map
- **Mobile app**: GPS-enabled tourist guide
- **Augmented reality**: Camera overlay with information
- **Social integration**: User reviews and photos

### Advanced Analytics
- **Tourist flow analysis**: Popular routes and attractions
- **Seasonal patterns**: Optimize information by time of year
- **Accessibility analytics**: Routes for different mobility needs
- **Economic impact**: Tourism spending and local business

### Community Integration
- **Local contributor network**: Residents providing updates
- **Tourist feedback**: Visitor experience integration
- **Business partnerships**: Direct integration with local services
- **Event management**: Dynamic event information

This comprehensive approach transforms the basic OSM map into a rich, multi-source tourist information system that provides detailed, accurate, and up-to-date information for visitors to the Lumsden area.
