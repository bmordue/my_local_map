# Immediate Next Steps - Task List

This document outlines the specific tasks to be completed in the immediate term to stabilize and enhance the Lumsden Tourist Map Generator.

## Priority 1: Fix Failing Tests

### Task 1: Analyze test_download_elevation_data_failure
**File**: `tests/test_elevation_processing.py`
**Issue**: Test expects `False` but gets `True`
**Details**: The test mocks a subprocess failure but the function still returns `True`

**Steps to Fix**:
1. Examine the `download_elevation_data` function in `utils/elevation_processing.py`
2. Identify why it returns `True` even when subprocess fails
3. Modify the function to properly handle subprocess failures
4. Update the test to match the expected behavior

### Task 2: Analyze test_download_elevation_data_success
**File**: `tests/test_elevation_processing.py`
**Issue**: Test expects subprocess to be called but it isn't
**Details**: The test expects `mock_subprocess.assert_called()` to pass but it fails

**Steps to Fix**:
1. Examine the code path in `download_elevation_data` when GDAL Python bindings are available
2. Identify why subprocess is not being called in that path
3. Either modify the code to call subprocess or update the test to match actual behavior
4. Ensure both GDAL Python bindings and subprocess paths are properly tested

## Priority 2: Run Full Test Suite

### Task 3: Execute complete test suite
**Command**: `nix-shell --run "python3 -m pytest tests/ -v"`
**Goal**: Confirm overall system stability after test fixes

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All tests pass (80/80)
- No new failures introduced
- Performance remains acceptable

## Priority 3: Research Elevation Data Sources

### Task 4: Identify elevation data sources for Lumsden area
**Research Areas**:
1. SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) data
2. OS Terrain 50 (Ordnance Survey)
3. EU-DEM (European Environment Agency)
4. Other freely available sources

**Deliverables**:
- List of available data sources with coverage information
- Resolution and accuracy details for each source
- Access methods (API, download, etc.)
- Licensing information

### Task 5: Evaluate integration approach
**Considerations**:
- Data format compatibility (GeoTIFF, etc.)
- Download and caching strategy
- Fallback mechanisms for offline use
- Performance impact on map generation

## Priority 4: Create Detailed Implementation Plan

### Task 6: Develop Phase 1 implementation tasks
**Based on Final Implementation Plan**:
1. Create detailed task list for stabilization phase
2. Estimate time for each task
3. Identify dependencies between tasks
4. Assign priorities within the phase

### Task 7: Set up project tracking
**Actions**:
1. Create GitHub issues for each task
2. Assign milestones for each phase
3. Set up project board for progress tracking
4. Establish regular review schedule

## Priority 5: Begin Implementation

### Task 8: Fix test_download_elevation_data_failure
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Dependencies**: None
**Deliverable**: Passing test

### Task 9: Fix test_download_elevation_data_success
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Dependencies**: Understanding of elevation data processing flow
**Deliverable**: Passing test

### Task 10: Verify full test suite
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
**Dependencies**: Tasks 8 and 9 completed
**Deliverable**: Confirmation of 100% test pass rate
