## Project Overview

The Lumsden Tourist Map Generator is a Python-based application that creates high-quality printable maps by combining OpenStreetMap data with custom tourist information and topographic features. This planning documentation provides a comprehensive roadmap for significantly enhancing the map's content, visual design, and functionality.

## Key Enhancement Areas

1. **Content Expansion**: Increase from ~4 basic categories to 20+ comprehensive content categories
2. **Visual Design**: Create a tourist-friendly visual design with improved symbology
3. **Topographic Features**: Integrate elevation data and contour lines for terrain context
4. **Data Integration**: Seamlessly integrate multiple data sources including OSM and custom tourist information
5. **User Experience**: Enhance usability for different types of visitors

## Implementation Approach

The project follows a structured 6-phase approach over 14 weeks:

1. **Foundation Enhancement** (Weeks 1-2): Fix existing issues and improve core processing
2. **Content Expansion** (Weeks 3-5): Significantly expand feature categories
3. **Advanced Cartographic Features** (Weeks 6-8): Implement topographic elements and navigation aids
4. **Additional Data Sources** (Weeks 9-11): Integrate external data sources
5. **Design and User Experience** (Weeks 12-13): Optimize visual design and usability
6. **Quality Assurance and Deployment** (Week 14): Final testing and release preparation

## Success Metrics

- Feature count increases from ~4 to 20+ categories
- Map visual richness and information density improves significantly
- Tourist utility enables comprehensive activity planning from the map alone
- Local accuracy reflects actual Lumsden area features
- Print quality maintains clarity at 300 DPI A3 format

This documentation provides the foundation for transforming the current basic map into a comprehensive tourist resource that provides detailed, accurate information for visitors planning activities in the Lumsden area.
