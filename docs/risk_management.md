- Implement caching mechanisms for frequently used data
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms
- Set performance benchmarks and monitor continuously

### 3. Elevation Data Integration Challenges
**Risk**: Difficulty integrating high-quality elevation data
**Impact**: Medium (Topographic features are important but not critical)
**Probability**: Medium
**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Research and test multiple elevation data sources
- Implement fallback to synthetic elevation data
- Create modular elevation processing that can be enhanced over time
- Document data source limitations and accuracy
- Provide options for different data quality levels

### 4. Mapnik Rendering Issues

- Clearly define scope boundaries
- Regular scope review meetings
- Prioritize features using MoSCoW method
- Communicate impact of changes to stakeholders

### 6. Resource Constraints
**Risk**: Insufficient personnel or time to complete all planned work
**Impact**: High (Project delivery would be compromised)
**Probability**: Medium
**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Regular progress tracking against roadmap
- Early identification of resource gaps
- Flexible prioritization of features
- Cross-training of team members
- Contingency planning for critical path items

### 7. Integration Complexity
**Risk**: Difficulty integrating multiple data sources and systems
**Impact**: Medium-High (Could delay implementation)
**Probability**: Medium
**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Develop integration in modular components
- Create comprehensive testing for each integration point
- Document data formats and transformation requirements
- Implement robust error handling for data integration
- Use standardized data formats where possible

## External Risks

### 8. API and Service Availability
**Risk**: Overpass API or other external services become unavailable
**Impact**: Medium (Could affect data acquisition)
**Probability**: Low
**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Create caching of previously downloaded data
- Develop alternative data sources
- Document manual data acquisition procedures
- Monitor service availability and plan accordingly

### 9. Licensing and Attribution Issues
**Risk**: Incorrect handling of data licenses and attribution requirements
**Impact**: High (Legal and reputational risk)
**Probability**: Low
**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Research and document all data source licenses
- Implement automated attribution systems
- Create clear attribution display in maps
- Establish legal review process for data sources
- Maintain records of data usage and attribution

## Quality Risks

### 10. User Acceptance
**Risk**: Final product does not meet user expectations or needs
**Impact**: High (Project success would be compromised)
**Probability**: Medium
**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Conduct regular user feedback sessions
- Create prototypes for early validation
- Implement usability testing throughout development
- Engage stakeholders in review processes
- Plan for iterative improvements based on feedback

### 11. Visual Design Issues
**Risk**: Map design is not appealing or usable
**Impact**: Medium (Affects user experience)
**Probability**: Medium
**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Engage design professionals in the process
- Conduct design reviews with target users
- Create multiple design variants for comparison
- Follow established cartographic best practices
- Implement design feedback loops

## Operational Risks

### 12. Documentation Gaps
**Risk**: Inadequate documentation affects maintenance and future development
**Impact**: Medium (Affects long-term sustainability)
**Probability**: High
**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Document continuously during development
- Create documentation templates and standards
- Assign documentation responsibilities to team members
- Review documentation as part of quality assurance
- Maintain documentation as code with version control

### 13. Testing Inadequacy
**Risk**: Insufficient testing leads to undetected defects
**Impact**: High (Affects product quality and reliability)
**Probability**: Medium
**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement automated testing at all levels
- Create comprehensive test plans for each feature
- Use test-driven development where appropriate
- Conduct regular test coverage analysis
- Include user acceptance testing in the process
