# BMad Planning Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive BMad planning work completed for the Lumsden Tourist Map Generator project.

## Planning Documents Created

1. **Vision and Goals** - Defined project vision, goals, and success metrics
2. **Stakeholders and Users** - Identified key stakeholders and created user personas
3. **Technical Architecture** - Documented system architecture and technology stack
4. **User Stories** - Created detailed user stories organized by epic
5. **Acceptance Criteria** - Defined specific acceptance criteria for core features
6. **Implementation Roadmap** - Created a detailed 14-week phased implementation plan
7. **Risk Management** - Identified risks and mitigation strategies
8. **Final Implementation Plan** - Created a prioritized plan based on current project status

## Key Insights

### Current Project Status
The project has a solid foundation with:
- Working OSM data processing pipeline
- Mapnik-based rendering engine
- Configuration-driven approach
- Comprehensive test suite (mostly passing)
- Topographic features in development (hillshading, contours)

### Immediate Priorities
1. Fix failing tests in elevation processing
2. Enhance elevation data integration with real DEM sources
3. Expand content categories from ~4 to 20+
4. Improve cartographic features and visual design

### Implementation Approach
The project will follow a structured approach:
- **Phase 1**: Stabilization (Fix tests, ensure stability)
- **Phase 2**: Elevation Enhancement (Real elevation data integration)
- **Phase 3**: Content Expansion (20+ feature categories)
- **Phase 4**: Cartographic Improvements (Labels, navigation aids)
- **Phase 5**: Quality Assurance (Testing, optimization)

## Success Metrics

The project will be measured against these criteria:
- Technical: 100% test pass rate, <2 min generation time, 20+ feature categories
- User Experience: Improved readability, comprehensive activity planning, 4.0+/5.0 user rating
- Maintainability: Clear architecture, comprehensive documentation, easy extensibility

## Next Steps

1. Fix failing tests in `test_elevation_processing.py`
2. Run full test suite to confirm system stability
3. Begin research on elevation data sources for Lumsden area
4. Create detailed task list for Phase 1 implementation

This planning work provides a solid foundation for transforming the current basic map into a comprehensive tourist resource that provides detailed, accurate information for visitors planning activities in the Lumsden area.
