## 1. Executive Summary

**Project Name**: My Local Map  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: Thursday, September 18, 2025  
**Author**: Qwen Code Assistant  

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the "My Local Map" project, an existing map generation system that creates printable A3 tourist maps for the Lumsden area in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The system currently generates maps using OpenStreetMap data enhanced with local tourism information.

### 1.2 Scope
This PRD covers enhancements to the existing system, including:
- Expanding coverage to additional areas beyond Lumsden
- Integrating new data sources for richer content
- Improving user experience and accessibility
- Adding advanced features like route planning and mobile support

### 1.3 Background
The My Local Map project is a Python-based system that generates high-quality, printable A3 tourist maps using OpenStreetMap data with enhanced local tourism information. It currently covers an 8×12km area around Lumsden with over 25 map feature categories, including natural features, transportation networks, points of interest, and elevation data with contour lines.

## 2. Current System Overview

### 2.1 Key Features
The current system generates:
- Printable A3 maps (297×420mm at 300 DPI)
- 25+ map feature categories including:
  - Natural features (forests, heath, moors, wetlands, grasslands, scree)
  - Land use (residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural areas)
  - Transportation (roads, railways, cycling paths, walking trails)
  - Points of interest (50+ amenity types including restaurants, hotels, attractions)
  - Buildings (categorized by type)
  - Place labels with hierarchical text sizing
  - Water features (rivers, streams, springs, water bodies)
  - Elevation data with contour lines
  - Comprehensive tourism categories (accommodation, dining, attractions, activities)
- Enhanced styling with hillshading for topographic relief
- Map legend for feature identification
- GeoJSON exports for enhanced data

### 2.2 Technical Architecture
